# Introduction to Markdown: A Beginner's Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple syntax. It is widely used for writing documentation, README files, and web content due to its ease of use and readability.

In this article, we will cover the basics of Markdown, including how to create headings, lists, links, images, and more.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax that converts text into HTML. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 and has since become a popular choice for writers and developers due to its simplicity and flexibility.

Markdown files typically have a `.md` or `.markdown` file extension. They can be easily converted to HTML or other formats using various tools and libraries.

## Basic Syntax

### Headings

Headings in Markdown are created using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols indicates the heading level, from 1 to 6.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```
